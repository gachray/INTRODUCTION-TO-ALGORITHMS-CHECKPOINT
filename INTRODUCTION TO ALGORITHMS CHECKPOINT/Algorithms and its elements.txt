1. Initialize three variables:
   - sentence_length to 0
   - word_count to 0
   - vowel_count to 0

2. Read the input sentence until a period is encountered

3. Loop through each character in the sentence:
   a. Increment sentence_length by 1
   b. If the character is a space, increment word_count by 1
   c. If the character is a vowel, increment vowel_count by 1

4. Increment word_count by 1 to account for the last word

5. Output the following:
   - "Length of the sentence: " followed by sentence_length
   - "Number of words in the sentence: " followed by word_count
   - "Number of vowels in the sentence: " followed by vowel_count
