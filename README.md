# INTRODUCTION-TO-ALGORITHMS-AND-BASIC-CONCEPTS-CHECKPOINT

TASK 1:
GoMyCode checkpoint for introduction to algorithms. The task is to write an algorithm that read a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character, and to determine:

Instructions

The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
The number of vowels in the sentence.
You have to keep in mind that: 

Each character will be treated separately.
The last character is the point.
Use three variables as counters.

TASK 2:
GoMyCode checkpoint for SORTING AND SEARCHING ALGORITHMS. The task is implementation of Insertion Sort using JavaScript:

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands. Each time we take a new card we put it in the right place in our hand.

Instructions

Each time work only with the first i-1 element from of the array
Pick element arr[i] and insert it into sorted sequence in the array from 0 to i-1.
